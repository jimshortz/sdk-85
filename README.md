This project contains assets for my Intel SDK-85 projects.

`.a80` files are assembled using `asm80` from
https://github.com/ogdenpm/c-ports. These can also be assembled using
the Intel ISIS `asm80` under Thames.

`.z80` files are assembled using `z80asm`
(https://github.com/AlbertVeli/z80asm) as installed by Homebrew.

The following sudirectories exist:
* simon - A clone of the 1978 Milton Bradley game.  Hand assembled!
* loader - A simple binary loader for 9600bps serial port
* chess - MicroChess by Peter Jennings and T O'Brien (1977)
* basic - Altair 8K BASIC by Microsoft (1978 version)
